        <h2>
          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Get started with Bootstrap, the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Quick Start
        </h2>
        <p>
          Looking to quickly add Bootstrap to your project? Use jsDelivr, a free open source CDN. Using a package manager or need to download the source files? <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/">Head to the downloads page.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>
          CSS
        </h2>
        <p>
          Copy-paste the stylesheet <code><span>&lt;</span><span>link</span><span>&gt;</span></code> into your <head> before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.
        </p>
        <code class="code">
          <span>&lt;</span><span>link</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&#34;</span> <span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;stylesheet&#34;</span> <span>integrity</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC&#34;</span> <span>crossorigin</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;anonymous&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
        </code>
        <h2>
          JS
        </h2>
        <p>
          Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require our own JavaScript plugins and Popper. Place one of the following <code><span>&lt;</span>script<span>&gt;</span></code>s near the end of your pages, right before the closing <code><span>&lt;</span>/body<span>&gt;</span></code> tag, to enable them.
        </p>
        <code class="code">
          <span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js&#34;</span> <span>integrity</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM&#34;</span> <span>crossorigin</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;anonymous&#34;</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>

          Learn how to theme, customize, and extend Bootstrap with Sass, a boatload of global options, an expansive color system, and more.

        <h2>
          Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are multiple ways to customize Bootstrap. Your best path can depend on your project, the complexity of your build tools, the version of Bootstrap you’re using, browser support, and more.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our two preferred methods are:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using Bootstrap via package manager so you can use and extend our source files.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Using Bootstrap’s compiled distribution files or jsDelivr so you can add onto or override Bootstrap’s styles.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While we cannot go into details here on how to use every package manager, we can give some guidance on using Bootstrap with your own Sass compiler.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who want to use the distribution files, review the getting started page for how to include those files and an example HTML page. From there, consult the docs for the layout, components, and behaviors you’d like to use.<br>
        </p>
        <p> 
          As you familiarize yourself with Bootstrap, continue exploring this section for more details on how to utilize our global options, making use of and changing our color system, how we build our components, how to use our growing list of CSS custom properties, and how to optimize your code when building with Bootstrap.

        <h2>
          Color
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bootstrap is supported by an extensive color system that themes our styles and components. This enables more comprehensive customization and extension for any project.
